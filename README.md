## Description

The Color Flipper it's an interactive webpage developed with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML 5, and CSS3.

Through this project, my main goal was to practice my acquired knowledge in Vanilla JS, using solutions as DOM manipulation: every time the user clicks on the button to get his new colors random colors(functions + addEventListener), the function will search in the colors collection (defined and storage as an Array previously).

### Technologies

- CSS;
